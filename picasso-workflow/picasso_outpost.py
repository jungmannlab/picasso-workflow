Module Name: picasso_outpost.py
Author: Heinrich Grabmayr
Initial Date: March 8, 2024
Description: This is a collection of exploratory DNA-PAINT analysis / picasso
	related functions which if useful should (potentially) be moved into the
	next picasso release. The reasoning to put them here is that it makes
	testing cycles faster.
